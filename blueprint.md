# Florida Blue Guide: AI-Powered Field Assistant

## App Concept & Vision

The Vision: To create a premier, AI-driven mobile application for Florida law enforcement officers that serves as an indispensable digital field guide. This app will empower officers by providing immediate, context-aware access to legal information, procedural guidance, and interactive training scenarios. It aims to enhance decision-making, ensure compliance, and improve officer safety and effectiveness in high-pressure situations. The app should feel like a trusted, intelligent partner in the officer's pocketâ€”authoritative, reliable, and incredibly fast.

## Target Audience

Primary Users: Sworn law enforcement officers in the state of Florida, from rookie patrol officers to seasoned detectives and supervisors.

Environment: They will use this app in the field, often under stressful and rapidly evolving conditions. This includes patrol cars, during traffic stops, at crime scenes, and while interviewing subjects.

Technical Proficiency: Varies widely. The UI must be exceptionally intuitive and require minimal training.

## Implementation Details

### AI-Powered "Street Smart" Search

1.  **Dependencies**: Add `firebase_core` and `firebase_ai` to `pubspec.yaml`. These packages provide the necessary tools to interface with Firebase and use the Gemini API.
2.  **Firebase Initialization**: Ensure Firebase is initialized in `lib/main.dart`.
3.  **Gemini API Usage**: Implement the search functionality using the Gemini API. The `generateText` method will take a plain-language query as input and return a concise, actionable summary.
4.  **UI Integration**: Integrate the search functionality into the `DashboardScreen`. Display the search results in the UI, categorized by type (Statute, Case Law, Scenario).
